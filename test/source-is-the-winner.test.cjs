/* THE SOURCE IS THE WINNER (Tom's ruling, 2026-09-17).
 *
 * The defect (ClickUp PM-12518 and PM-12526, root-caused 2026-09-16): a task
 * published in ClickUp leaves the open fetch, reconcile writes `status: done`
 * onto the planner note and marks the shadow done, and Obsidian's
 * metadataCache `changed` event fires on that write. The push check could not
 * tell the plugin's own hand from a person's edit, read the note as
 * "unchecked while the shadow says done", and PUT the list's FIRST OPEN
 * status back to ClickUp 1.1 seconds later. A published episode became
 * `not started`, four times over two days.
 *
 * The rule now, in one line: a completion crosses from Obsidian to the
 * source, never the other way. "Complete on source" means checking a card
 * here closes the task there. It never reopens a task at the source and
 * never rewrites a source status to make it agree with a note. The single
 * exception is the person's own uncheck of a card, which carries the
 * explicit `reopen_pending` flag that only toggleDoneLocal writes.
 *
 * Three gates, driven end to end through the real upsertSource and
 * detectAndPush against a recording connector, so "zero source writes" means
 * zero calls to the thing that speaks HTTP:
 *   a. a task closed at the source: reconcile plus the push check, no writes
 *   b. a check here with the setting on: exactly one completion write
 *   c. the setting off: no source write at all
